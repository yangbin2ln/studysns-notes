## Examples

We have several articles and examples on the [JW Player Support Site](http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/topics/564475-javascript-api/articles).

The example below will find the element with an id of *myVideoId* and render a video player into it. We will then
create an event handler to watch for when someone changes the volume.

```js
	jwplayer('myVideoId').setup({
		file: '/uploads/example.mp4',
	});

	jwplayer('myVideoId').onVolume(function(event) {
		console.log('The volume has changed', event);
	});
```

Note that we could also use functions **getVolume**, **setVolume** and others which can be found [here](http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/topics/564475-javascript-api/articles).

### Build Instructions

To build the JW Player, you will need the following software:

 * Flex SDK 4.1: http://sourceforge.net/adobe/flexsdk/wiki/Downloads/
 * Ant 1.7.0: http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

To compile with Flex and Ant, you'll first need to modify the `build.properties` file found in the `build` folder:

1. Set `flexsdk` to the install location of the Flex SDK (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/flex/`)
1. Set `execextension` to `.exe` if you're using Windows; otherwise leave it blank.

You can now compile the player using Ant:

```sh
ant -buildfile build\build.xml
```

If the build is successful, the new player assets (jwplayer.js, jwplayer.html5.js, jwplayer.flash.swf) will appear in the `bin-release` folder.
